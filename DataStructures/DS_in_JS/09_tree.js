/*
    A Tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges.
    A tree is a non-linear data structure, compared to arrays, linked list, stacks and queues which are linear data structures.
    In linear data structure, the time required to search is proportional to the size of the data set, ie. more data more time needed to search.
    Trees however, owing to the non linear nature allow quicker and easier access to the data.
    A tree will not contain any loops or cycles.

    Usage:--
    - Family tree
    - Organization tree
    - DOM Tree
    - Chat bots
    - Abstract syntax trees

    Terminology:
    Root Node, Parent Node, Child Node, Leaf Node, Siblings, Ancestor Node, Successor Node, Degree, Degree Tree, Path, Distance, Height, Depth
